# TrendingAndroidRepo
The main idea of the test project is to build a Native Android App that has 2 Screens: 
1. A list of trending Github repositories of android 
2. A simple “Detail View” of the detail information of the repository, been accessed when the user taps on one of the repositories of the list. 

#Libraries
