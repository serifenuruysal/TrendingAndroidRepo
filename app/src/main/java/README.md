What to do: The main idea of the test project is to build a Native Android App that has 2 Screens:

1. A list of trending Github repositories of android
2. A simple “Detail View” of the detail information of the repository, been accessed when
 the user taps on one of the repositories of the list.
 
Try to: - Use Retrofit2 for the network call. - Java or Kotlin (Kotlin preferable).

NOTE: Please create a git repository for the example (simulate that it's a real project).
 If there is something not specified, please be free to take the decision on it.

*Don’t use a base generic project as a base for this one.
